Draw with Nose
===========================

After a few bumpy rides, I have been able to create a recreation of a famous instagram filter that trended in 2020.

I used facial recognition from ml5, and implemented the following features for my project.
- Drawing with the tip of your nose
- Changing color by raising both of your eyebrows
- Clicking Reset button to empty your nose-drawing
- Randomizing topics to draw
